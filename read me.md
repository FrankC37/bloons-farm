# Monkey Money / Knowledge Farm

## Assumptions
- This starts fresh fresh from the main screen
- Some event popups do not have their "logic" built in, so it is not a 100% hands off run
- Runs Deflation on the Inferno Map
- Python 3 installed
- PyAutoGui installed
- 1440x900 resolution monitor


## Known Issues
- Sometimes towers fail to place and cause the map to fail
  

## Included Files
- infernoFarm.py -> This is the main script to run once you have coordinates setup
- dynamicCursorCheck.py -> This inclused a simple function from the creator of PyAutoGui to get the current positon of your cursor to help map your coordiates if you use a different resolution.
- staticCursorCheck.py -> Simple function i use to check coordiantes on my macbook setup for farming.
