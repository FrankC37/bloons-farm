# Monkey Money / Knowledge Farm

## Assumptions
- This starts fresh fresh from the main screen
- Some event popups do not have their "logic" built in so it is not a 100% hands off run
- Runs Deflation on the Inferno Map

## Known Issues
- Sometimes towers fail to place and fill cause failure
  

## Included Files
- infernoFarm.py -> This is the main script to run once you have coordinates setup
- cursorPositionChecker.py -> This inclused a simple function from the creator of PyAutoGui to get the current positon of your cursor to help map your coordiates if you use a different resolution.
